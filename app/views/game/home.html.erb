	<h2>The Lost Treasure of Z</h2>
	<p>You are in a junk store in South America, when you stumble upon the journal of Sir Reginald Higginbotham, the famous explorer, who disappeared many years ago, searching for the lost treasure of Z.  Sir Reginald was last seen in this very town, and what happened to him has long been a mystery. Leafing through the pages, you find that many of the pages are smeared and difficult to read.  You can make out a few words.  Most interesting is a sketch in the back of the book.</P>
